The final project did meet all the planned criteria of the timeline, with minor variation in the completion time for each criterion. Although, whilst certain aspects were finished in accordance with the planning they did not quite meet the specific requirements posted in the original project planning. Within the web application it does meet the criteria in regard to centralising information, through the working messaging and email system although did not contain a clear dashboard inside the classroom route. Whilst this was not explicitly stated in the timeline it was a goal in the original project planning, and was not met by the final date.

One of the goals of Atschool was to reduce waiting time, this was the reason for technologies such as React and WebSockets, it can be said with certainty that this criteria was met, and that the majority of time spent on the project was to make this goal a reality.

One of the major challenges in loading time was the email route, as it took a surplus of 30 seconds to query emails from the Google SMTP servers. This was resolved through creating a local database to store emails in JSON format to make querying instantaneous as well as multi threading the server and use of websockets. This meant the slow new queries from the Google server could happen as a background process allowing for maximum efficiency for the user.

Another problem we had was the compatibility between our various technologies, for instance the wtf-kit not supporting the newest version of css, as such we had to have inconsistencies in our app, some parts using the latest version of css while others use an older version. We also had to make a recursive function in order to convert our Javascript styling in Aphrodite to text that could be compiled to css in use of the PDF module in python.

Originally we had used SQL, although later changed to to monogDB to improve efficiency, this was not originally predicted in the project planning although

Arguably the major reason that some criteria were not fully met was due to the change in hosting service, originally the application was hosted on GitHub pages, although there was a problem with React Router and the service, that didnâ€™t allow you to directly access a URL from the URL bar. This meant we needed to change the service provider Amazon AWS which was quite time consuming given our lack of knowledge.
